FUNTASTIC PROJECT 1 - SWOLEMATES

What is Smolemates?

2019 APP OF THE YEAR!!! 

Have you ever wanted to go to a gym, but did not feel like going alone? Swolemates is an application to find your most compatible workout buddy based off of a number of user preferences. We pool user's inputs, which range from location preferences, availability, sex, and profile (age, activity, goals) and compare them between different users. Once paired, users can decide on their own time how to contact each other so they they can meet their fitness goals and become swole! Users also have access to other features that will improve their Swolemates experience!

- There is currently no log out button, so if another user wants to use the app, the user must refresh the page to re-initialiaze the application
- Profile picture functionality does not work, because there is no back-end integration
